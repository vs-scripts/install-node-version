RFC: 0.0.0
Title: Privacy Policy
Author: Richeve Bebedor <richeve.bebedor+vs-scripts@gmail.com>
Status: Draft
Created: 2025-12-20

1.  Introduction:

    This Privacy Policy outlines the commitment of the install-node-version
    project to protecting your privacy. This policy is designed to align with
    international standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

2.  Privacy by Design:

    The install-node-version script is designed with "Privacy by Design"
    principles. It operates as a local utility and does not include any
    telemetry, tracking, or automated data transmission to external servers or
    third parties.

3.  Data Collection:

    3.1. Personal Data:
         The script does not collect, store, or transmit personal data such as
         names, emails, or IP addresses.
    3.2. Technical Data:
         The script interacts only with your local system environment (e.g.,
         file paths, environment variables, and tool versions) to perform its
         intended function. This data remains local to your machine.

4.  Log and Error Handling:

    Any logs or error reports generated during execution are stored on your
    local file system (e.g., in the tests/logs/ directory if applicable). These
    files are for your own diagnostic use and are not shared automatically.

5.  Data Transmission:

    No data is transmitted to external entities unless explicitly initiated by
    the user (for example, by manually sharing an error log via email for
    support).

6.  User Rights:

    Consistent with global privacy laws, you have the following rights:
    6.1. Right to Access: You have full access to the source code and local
         outputs of the script.
    6.2. Right to Erasure: You can erase all local data related to the project
         simply by deleting the repository folder and the local Volta
         configuration.
    6.3. Right to Object: You can object to data processing by choosing not to
         execute the script.

7.  Cookies and Tracking:

    This project does not use cookies, pixels, or any other tracking
    technologies.

8.  Contact Information:
