1.  Summary:

    Stabilize and clarify the RFC FORMAT specification by removing ambiguity,
    resolving inconsistencies, and tightening testable rules before adding
    further sections or expanding scope.

2.  Structure:

    - Clarify the RFC identifier pattern:

        - Define whether CONCISE-RFC-000000 is a template placeholder or a
          literal identifier.
        - Define the canonical RFC naming pattern (e.g., CONCISE-RFC-XXXXXX).

            Answer:

                - Instead of using CONCISE-RFC-000000 as a template placeholder,
                  use CONCISE-RFC-XXXXXX as the literal identifier.

    - Clarify file encoding and line endings:

        - Define required text encoding (e.g., UTF-8, BOM or no BOM).
        - Define required EOL style (LF vs CRLF).
        - Clarify whether files MUST end with a trailing newline.

            Answer:

                - Add a structural clause in the Structure section that
                  all CONCISE-RFC-XXXXXX documents MUST be encoded in
                  UTF-8 without BOM.
                - Add a structural clause in the Structure section that
                  all CONCISE-RFC-XXXXXX documents MUST use LF as the EOL style.
                - Add a structural clause in the Structure section that
                  all CONCISE-RFC-XXXXXX documents MUST end with a trailing newline.

    - Define STRICTLY precisely:

        - Define whether STRICTLY means exact, byte-for-byte literal match.
        - Remove redundant MUST STRICTLY combinations if semantics overlap.

            Answer:

                - Remove the STRICTLY word from all affected clauses.
                - Add compliance clause in the compliance section that
                  all AI agents must adhere to the normative language requirements.

    - Normalize begin/end sentinels:

        - Specify exact literal sentinel lines rather than character-by-character
          construction, or define computed length and validate against 83 cols.
        - Decide on ENDED-CRFCF vs END-CRFCF and standardize.

            Answer:

                - We will use ENDED-CRFCF.
                - Character by character construction is a must because it
                  is the structural representation in descriptive format.
                - Modify the phrase not to use space separated but rather
                  "surrounded by 1 space" if this is correct in your sense.

    - Define CHECKSUM scope and verification:

        - Define what is hashed (entire file, excluding CHECKSUM line, etc.).
        - Define canonical hashing algorithm usage and whitespace handling.

    - Resolve naming convention scope conflicts:

        - Clarify what rules apply to RFC docs vs repo metadata docs vs todo
          issue files (e.g., lowercase hyphenated *.todo).

            Answer:

                - All METADATA files must follow all uppercase one word file name.
                - All *.todo files MUST follow the prescribed naming convention
                  its file names in the FORMAT file.

    - Resolve scope creep / SRP conflicts:

        - Decide whether repository layout, versioning rules, changelog rules,
          and todo taxonomy belong in FORMAT or should be separate RFCs.

            Answer:

                - We will follow the METADATA file for the non-negotiable
                  format category.
                - We will follow the FORMAT file for the non-negotiable
                  format structure.

    - Clarify table-of-contents numbering:

        - Define whether TOC numbers are line offsets and MUST be updated, or
          remove numeric offsets if not stable.

            Answer:

                - It will always be updated whenever there are changes.

3.  Compliance:

    - This todo is complete when all clarified rules are unambiguous, testable
      by tooling, and do not contradict each other within the FORMAT document.
    - Any changes MUST preserve the existing high-level section order unless
      explicitly approved by a new STABLE RFC.
