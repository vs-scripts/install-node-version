1.  Summary:

    Enhanced path traversal protection for restrict-pre-commit-atomic.zig
    dispatcher to address incomplete security validation in buildScriptPath
    function.

2.  Structure:

    - Current Limitation:

        The buildScriptPath function has incomplete path traversal protection
        that only checks for literal ".." strings but does not handle other
        traversal attack vectors.

    - Security Gaps:

        - Does not handle encoded variants like %2e%2e, %2E%2E
        - Does not validate against absolute paths
        - Does not protect against symlink attacks
        - Does not handle Unicode normalization attacks
        - Does not enforce directory boundary validation

    - Security Impact:

        Potential for path traversal attacks if executable is placed in
        malicious directory could lead to execution of unintended scripts
        outside the expected directory.

    - Proposed Solution:

        Implement comprehensive path validation including canonical path
        resolution, encoded character detection and decoding, absolute path
        rejection, symlink resolution and validation, Unicode normalization
        checks, and directory boundary enforcement.

3.  Compliance:

    - Priority: Medium (mitigated by controlled deployment environment)
    - This issue is complete when comprehensive path validation is implemented
      or explicitly documented as out of scope with security implications.
