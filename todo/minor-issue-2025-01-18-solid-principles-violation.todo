    - RFC:      CONCISE-RFC-000000
    - GROUP:    VS-SCRIPTS
    - TITLE:    SOLID PRINCIPLES VIOLATION IN RESTRICT PRE COMMIT ATOMIC
    - ACRONYM:  SPVRPCA

    - CATEGORY: SPECIFICATION
    - STATUS:   DRAFT

1.  Summary:

    Refactor main function in restrict-pre-commit-atomic.zig to address
    Single Responsibility Principle violation and improve alignment with
    project 5LAWS requirements.

2.  Structure:

    - Current Violations:

        The main function handles multiple responsibilities including
        executable path extraction and parsing, command-line argument
        processing, script path construction and validation, file existence
        checking, command execution and process management, and error handling
        and exit code management.

    - Impact on 5LAWS:

        - Violates "SYSTEMS SHOULD BE S.O.L.I.D." law
        - Reduces "SYSTEMS SHOULD BE CONCISE" by creating complex function
        - Impacts maintainability and testability

    - Proposed Refactoring:

        Break main function into focused functions including parseExecutablePath
        for extracting command name from executable path, validateScriptExists
        for checking script file availability, executeScript for handling
        platform-specific execution, and handleProcessResult for managing exit
        codes and termination.

    - Benefits:

        Improved testability with individual functions for unit testing, better
        error isolation, clearer code organization, easier maintenance and
        debugging, and alignment with SOLID principles.

3.  Compliance:

    - Priority: Low (functional code works correctly)
    - This issue is complete when main function is refactored into focused
      single-responsibility functions or explicitly accepted as current design.
